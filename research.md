<h3>Multistage 2D DoA Estimation in Low SNR</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">
        Advised by: Dr. Dola Saha and Dr. Aveek Dutta 
       <span style="float:right;">
        2022 – present
       </span>
  </p>
  <p> • propose a three stage algorithm that methodically exploits digital beamforming, creates virtual subarrays, inspects multiple options and       
  introduces clustering to estimate the DoA in low SNRs</p>

<h3>RFI cancellation using RIS</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">
        Advised by: Dr. Dola Saha and Dr. Aveek Dutta 
       <span style="float:right;">
        2022 – present
       </span>
  </p>
  <p> • estimate incident RFI of the telescope and configure Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface(number, spacing, etc.)</p>
  <p> • find the solution of amplitude and phase of each element of RIS to reflect incident RFI of RIS in order to cancel RFI in the telescope</p>

<h3>Key generation</h3>

  </p>
  ![Alt text](/file/cat.jpeg?raw=true "Title")
  <p> • propose a Key Generation model using neural networks from wireless Channels</p>
  <p> • extract the implicit features of channel in a compressed form to derive keys with high KGR and low KDR</p>

<h3>Wireless steganography</h3>
<!--   <p> Advised by: Dr. Dola Saha 2021 – present</p>  -->
 <p style="text-align:left;">
      Advised by: Dr. Dola Saha 
     <span style="float:right;">

     </span>
  </p>
 <p> • design a complex-valued neural network to hide the transmission of secret signals</p>
 <p> • this method has nothing to do with any properties of the covert signal (such as waveform or modulation order)</p>
 <p> • use complex-valued neural networks, which is more powerful and has a faster learning speed than real-valued neural network</p>
 <p> • transmit signals over the air and apply the transfer learning method to retrain the model again to further optimize the system and get a lower bit error rate </p>

<h3>Teaching human motion</h3>
<!--  <p> Advised by: Dr. Weifu Wang 2019 – 2020</p>  -->
 <p style="text-align:left;">
      Advised by: Dr. Weifu Wang 
     <span style="float:right;">
      2019 – 2020
     </span>
  </p>
 <p> • offer a systematic exploration of how to decompose complicated physical motions to make motion more
 <p> • interpretable and easier to learn for humans
 <p> •  build a teaching environment in a virtual environment (VR + unity)
 <p> •  use real robot teaching frontend to demonstrate motion clips(sign language, breaststroke, butterfly, etc)</p>
