 Key generation 2022 – present
Advised by: Dr. Dola Saha
• propose a Key Generation model using neural networks from wireless Channels
• extract the implicit features of channel in a compressed form to derive keys with high KGR and low KDR
Wireless steganography 2021 – present
Advised by: Dr. Dola Saha
• design a complex-valued neural network to hide the transmission of secret signals
• this method has nothing to do with any properties of the covert signal (such as waveform or modulation order)
• use complex-valued neural networks, which is more powerful and has a faster learning speed than real-valued
neural network
• transmit signals over the air and apply the transfer learning method to retrain the model again to further
optimize the system and get a lower bit error rate
Teaching human motion 2019 – 2020
Advised by: Dr. Weifu Wang
• offer a systematic exploration of how to decompose complicated physical motions to make motion more
interpretable and easier to learn for humans
• build a teaching environment in a virtual environment (VR + unity)
• use real robot teaching frontend to demonstrate motion clips(sign language, breaststroke, butterfly, etc)
